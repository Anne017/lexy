Lexy gives Ubuntu Touch users the ability to control Amazon Alexa enabled devices from their phone. This app does not include the voice assistant. It is only to be used to control Alexa-enabled devices (media controls), access settings, add/edit/remove linked smart home devices and skills and more. Huge thanks to advocatux for the Spanish translation.
